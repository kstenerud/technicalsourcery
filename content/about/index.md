I'm Karl, a Canadian software developer by profession with a passion for open source. Over the years, I've built many systems that businesses and people depend upon, including:

 * Current: [Concise Encoding](https://concise-encoding.org/index.html)
 * 2012: [KSCrash](https://github.com/kstenerud/KSCrash) (crash reporter for Apple devices)
 * 2010: [ObjectAL](https://github.com/kstenerud/ObjectAL-for-iPhone) (audio library for Apple devices)
 * 2006: [HSE](http://hse.sourceforge.net/) (MVC web component framework for Java)
 * 1997: [Musashi M680x0 emulator](https://github.com/kstenerud/Musashi) (used in MAME, Namco Classics, SNK Classics, etc)
 * 1996: [Ringconnectd](https://www.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/system/network/daemons/ringconnectd.lsm) (telephone ring knocking daemon)
 * 1995: [DOS serial library](https://github.com/kstenerud/DOS-Serial-Library)

I'll likely continue innovating until my last breath. But I'm only one person, and there are only so many hours in a day.
