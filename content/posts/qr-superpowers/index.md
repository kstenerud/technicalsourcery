[QR codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code) have replaced bar codes in many places because they can store a lot more information, but this advantage is limited by the fact that they can only store textual data and have no inherent structure. In this post, I'll demonstrate how to overcome these limitations and give QR codes superpowers!

## QR Codes and Their Limitations

QR codes were invented by the Japanese company Denso Wave in the mid-90s as a way to get higher information density in machine-readable optical labels. They support a number of encoding methods including numeric digits, alphanumerics, kanji, and raw text. Although the QR format does have an encoding called "byte mode", each byte in this mode represents an ISO 8859-1 character, not binary data.

[ECI](https://symbology.dev/docs/encoding.html#extended-channel-interpolation-eci) escape sequences allow encoding of nonstandard text encodings, but each escape code bloats the message with out-of-band data (they have to be long in order to minimize the chance of misinterpreting data as escapes), and still binary data is not supported üòû

If you did try to write binary data, it would likely just end up garbled once a reader tries to interpret it as text (some decoders apply heuristics to guess at the intended format, complicating things even further). So there's no reliable way to directly encode binary data into a QR code, let alone ad-hoc structured binary data.

... Or is there? With a little creative thinking, some minor algorithmic tweaks and the [Concise Encoding format](https://concise-encoding.org), it's possible to work around this limitation to reliably read and write binary ad-hoc structured data in QR codes!

To see how, let's take a look at the text encoding used for "byte mode": **ISO 8859-1**.

Notice how the codes **00-1f** and **7f-9f** are unassigned (many text formats do this for legacy reasons). This means that any non-ECI data containing these values is invalid because it can't be decoded as text.

**Side Note**: Not all QR decoders actually validate this, which is why you sometimes get strange garbled results after decoding a QR code that was mistakenly encoded in UTF-8 without an ECI header.

So even though there are no technical limitations against using them, unassigned characters are considered invalid, which means that any valid QR code will not contain them.

Or to put it another way: **these characters are up for grabs!**

What we could do is re-purpose one of these unassigned characters and use it as a sentinel to indicate the presence of special, non-textual data. When a scanner that knows about the sentinel byte encounters it as the first byte of the payload, it can switch decoding modes reliably.

## Encoding ad-hoc binary data into QR codes

[Concise Encoding](https://concise-encoding.org) is an ad-hoc data format with a text and a binary encoding form. In the [binary format (CBE)](https://github.com/kstenerud/concise-encoding/blob/master/cbe-specification.md), all documents begin with the sentinel byte [0x83](https://github.com/kstenerud/concise-encoding/blob/master/cbe-specification.md#version-specifier) (specifically chosen because it's an invalid starting byte in most popular text formats, including ISO 8859 and UTF-8). We'll leverage this to encode a CBE document into a QR code.

I've adapted https://github.com/kstenerud/enctool to support QR codes and initiate special processing when the first byte of the QR data is `0x83`. You can follow along by [installing the go language on your system](https://go.dev/doc/install) and then installing `enctool` like so:
```
go install github.com/kstenerud/enctool@latest
```

This will install `enctool` into `$GOPATH/bin` (usually `go/bin` in your home directory).

We'll be using enctool's `convert` functionality. You can see the available options by typing:

```
enctool convert -h
```

### Example

As an example, let's assume that we're coming up with a new international shipping and storage requirements QR code format. We have an example document that we want to encode into a QR code. I'm writing it here in the text format ([CTE](https://github.com/kstenerud/concise-encoding/blob/master/cte-specification.md)) for convenience, but the actual data will be written in the binary format ([CBE](https://github.com/kstenerud/concise-encoding/blob/master/cbe-specification.md)).

```cte
c1 {
    "temperature range" = [-20 5]
    "hazards" = [
        "pressurized"
        "flammable"
        "fragile"
    ]
    "max tilt degrees" = 15
    "perishes after" = 2022-12-05
}
```

Save this document as `with-text.cte`, and then convert to CBE like so:

```
enctool convert -s with-text.cte -sf cte -df cbe -d with-text.cbe
```

How big is it?

```
ls -l with-text.cbe
-rw-rw-r-- 1 karl karl 105 Jan  6 17:15 with-text.cbe
```

105 bytes... But that's mainly due to the many text fields it contains. We could encode it as-is, but it would produce a pretty big QR code!

What if instead we came up with a schema that replaces all well-known text keys and values with integer enumerations? For completeness sake we'll also include a "fourCC" style identifier so that any reader can identify which schema and version the data was encoded with (let's say that key 0 is always used to specify the schema).

Fictional Schema:
* 0 = schema ID and version adherence: **(fourCC-style integer: "TSS" + version)**
* 1 = temperature range: **(list of two integers)**
* 2 = hazards: **(list of enumerated integers)**:
  - 0 = corrosive
  - 1 = photoreactive
  - ...
  - 4 = pressurized
  - ...
  - 6 = flammable
  - ...
  - 19 = fragile
* ...
* 4 = max tilt degrees: **(integer)**
* ...
* 9 = perishes after: **(date)**

Document (CTE):
```cte
c1 {
    0 = 0x54535301 // Transport and Storage Schema version 1 ("TSS" + 1)
    1 = [-20 5]    // Temperature range from -20 to 5
    2 = [          // Hazards:
        4             // Pressurized
        6             // Flammable
        19            // Fragile
    ]
    4 = 15         // Max 15 degrees tilt
    9 = 2022-12-05 // Perishes after Dec 5, 2022
}
```

Because integers from -100 to 100 encode into a single byte in CBE, you can achieve tremendous space savings using them as enumerated types. Let's try it with our modifications (saving this document as `with-enums.cte`):

```
enctool convert -s with-enums.cte -sf cte -df cbe -d with-enums.cbe
```

Now how big is it?

```
ls -l with-enums.cbe 
-rw-rw-r-- 1 karl karl 28 Jan  6 17:22 with-enums.cbe
```

From our original 105 bytes to 28 bytes! Much better!

Now let's try encoding this data into a QR code:

```
enctool convert -s with-enums.cte -sf cte -df qr -d qr.png -b 1 -is 400
```

The newly created `qr.png` contains the QR code:

{{< figure src="qr.png" >}}

Now let's read the data back (I'm omitting the destination file so that `enctool` prints to stdout, and I'm making it print in CTE for human convenience):

```
enctool convert -s qr.png -sf qr -df cte
c0
{
    0 = 1414746881
    1 = [
        -20
        5
    ]
    2 = [
        4
        6
        19
    ]
    4 = 15
    9 = 2022-12-05
}
```

Once we've got our document, we can process it through the schema to recover the true meaning of the data.

So there you have it: Supercharged QR codes that can hold arbitrary structured data! Neat!
