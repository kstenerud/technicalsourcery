When I first entered software development professionally, it was a very different time. Dress codes had loosened somewhat: You didn't have to wear a tie anymore, but one was still expected to wear a dress shirt and slacks to be taken seriously. Noon beers were a normal part of professional life. Cube land had just begun (the old-style cube farms that had 2 meter walls). This was of course a cost cutting measure to fit all of the lower people into the available real estate while still offering offices to the higher-ups, sold as a way to increase employee interaction "because they're closer together now". Everyone affected just accepted the inevitable and set up as many psychological barriers to entry as they could. Requiring employees to "earn" an office always seemed to me completely self-defeating, but humans are acutely status-oriented so that's how it went with the offices vs cubes.

When I moved to Japan, I was presented with an entirely different reality: Picture a football field sized room, filled completely with long tables that fit 12 people per side, with the local boss on one end and 25 employees trying desperately to look busy the whole day. There were four rows of 50 of these desks in the hall where I worked. My productivity of course plummeted. It's amazing the amount of anxiety that this level of exposure brings, and an inability to be comfortable at all put a huge damper on my creativity, resulting in some of the worst code I've ever written (oh, it worked and solved their problems - barely, but it was a nasty mess and I felt sorry for the person who inherited it).

When I returned to the Americas, times were already a-changing, but not so quickly in the banking industry where I took a job migrating a mainframe-based COBOL system to Java. For the first year, I effectively had a room all to myself. There were two others who were sometimes at desks on the other side of the room, but they spent almost the entire day in meetings. During this time, I built an entire web-based GUI supporting real-time updates for the check processing department to replace their fleet of 3270 terminals. It was a huge success, and I was asked to spearhead another initiative. Then word came down that the entire engineering staff would be moved to a single floor. Suddenly, I found myself in a half-height cube farm on a giant open floor with 200 other people. The old anxiety came flooding back and my productivity and creativity tanked. I quit shortly thereafter.

After that, I went from company to company, but all had been bitten by open floor plan fever. I took to hiding out in the bathrooms and making every excuse imaginable to just get the hell out of the thoroughfare for even a few minutes. Forget building anything meaningful; I was in full-on survival mode. I took to wearing headphones and blasting trance into my ears all hours of the day as a coping mechanism (which elevated me from the 9th circle of hell to the 5th). In the mid 2010s I hit my breaking point: I quit my job, packed my bags, left the Bay Area and moved to a farm in Canada, working remotely over a cellular modem. Remote jobs were hard to come by at that time, but I made do, and I noticed immediately how my productivity, creativity, and wellbeing came back. I'd wake up in the morning, set up the irrigation lines, have a nice breakfast, do a day's software development, move the irrigation lines over, fix some fencing, cook a nice meal, and then sit outside to enjoy a beer and listen to the trees. Paradise.

Obviously, there are people who thrive in the hustle and bustle of a noisy, busy office, but I'm definitely not one of them. Most of my time is spent staring off into space or walking alone as I wrestle with complex problems, interspersed with talks with clients, other engineers, or whoever I think can help fill in any gaps as I go. I need interaction to happen on my terms, in my timing, and a public thoroughfare like what the modern office has become is not conducive to that. In the old days, I could just close my office door. Nowadays, I can only get this by working remotely.

With the pandemic, remote work has gotten a lot easier to find and is more accepted at large, which is great for me because I absolutely will not return to the company office. My sanity and productivity depend upon it.
