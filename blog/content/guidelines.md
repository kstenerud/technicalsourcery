When posting comments, please keep the following guidelines in mind:

### Keep it civil aka don’t be a jerk

We’re going to get into the thick of a lot of heated discussions and that’s okay. These discussions often entail topics that we all personally care a lot about and will passionately defend. But in order for discussions to thrive here, we need to remember to criticize ideas, not people.

So, remember to avoid:

* name-calling
* ad hominem attacks
* Responding to a post’s tone instead of its actual content.
* knee-jerk contradiction

Comments that we find to be hateful, inflammatory, or harassing may be removed. If you don’t have something nice to say about another user, don't say it. Treat others the way you’d like to be treated.


### Always strive to add value to every interaction and discussion you participate in

Before joining in a discussion, browse through some of the most recent and active discussions happening in the community, especially if you’re new there.

If you are not sure your post adds to the conversation, think over what you want to say and try again later.


### Keep it tidy

Please take a moment to ensure that what you’re about to post is in the right place. That means:

* don’t post off-topic comments or discussions
* don’t cross-post the same thing multiple times
* If you see something, say something
* Moderators are at the forefront of combatting spam, mediating disputes and enforcing community guidelines and, so are you.

If you see an issue, contact the moderators if possible or flag any comments for review. If you believe someone has violated the Basic Rules, report it to Disqus by flagging the user's profile.
